    A cosmic explosion known as the Brightest of All Time (BOAT) has intrigued astrophysicists worldwide since its recording on October 22 of the previous year. The explosion, caused by the collapse of a massive star and the subsequent formation of a black hole, emitted an intense flash of gamma rays followed by a slow-fading afterglow. A team of international researchers, including Dr. Hendrik Van Eerten from the University of Bath, has proposed an explanation for the unique characteristics of the event. Their findings suggest that the initial burst, named GRB 221009A, was aimed directly at Earth and carried an unusually large amount of stellar material. This alignment and the mixing of the material with the jet resulted in the brightness and wider-than-normal structure of the explosion. The researchers believe that further investigation into the magnetic fields and host stars involved in such events will shed light on the rare and extreme nature of these gamma-ray bursts. The team considers this particular burst, which is the brightest ever recorded, as a unique opportunity to gain insights into black hole formation and test dark matter models.
