    Uranus, one of the ice giants beyond the gas giants in our solar system. It mentions that Uranus has two sets of rings and has completed less than three full orbits since its discovery in 1781. It also notes that only two seasons have passed since Voyager 2 passed Uranus in 1986. Recently, photographs from the Hubble Space Telescope show that Uranus is becoming paler, potentially due to seasonal changes. This discovery raises questions about the planet's cloud cover. Dr. Sabine Stanley, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, addresses some of these questions in her video series called "A Field Guide to the Planets."

<h2 class="galaxy" id="wdurois">Why Does Uranus Rotate on Its Side?
</h2>
<p class="galaxy">
    Uranus has a unique feature: it appears to be rotating on its side due to its tilt of 98° from its orbital axis. This is unlike other planets in our solar system, which have smaller tilts or no tilts at all. Dr. Sabine Stanley suggests that the most likely explanation for Uranus's tilt is a glancing collision with an Earth-sized protoplanet during its formation. Such a collision would have changed Uranus's rotation vector. This explanation is consistent with the theory used to explain the tilts of other planets and even the creation of Earth's Moon. However, Dr. Stanley finds it somewhat unsatisfying that yet another chance encounter in the early solar system resulted in a major characteristic of a planet.

    How Do Seasons Change on Uranus?
</h2>
<p class="galaxy">
    Due to its 98° tilt and long orbital period, the vernal equinox on Uranus occurred in 2007 and summer won't arrive until 2028. Living in the northern hemisphere of Uranus during summer would mean constant sunlight for 21 Earth years, while not heading south for winter would result in a single night lasting another 21 years. However, during the times of spring and fall equinoxes, Uranus experiences more typical day-night cycles. The passage highlights that on Uranus, unlike Earth, it's the poles that receive the most sunlight when averaged over the Uranian year, but there are extended periods of decades where each pole receives no sunlight at all. As a result, the understanding of weather patterns and climate in relation to seasons needs to be completely reevaluated for a planet like Uranus.
