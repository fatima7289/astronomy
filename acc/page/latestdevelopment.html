          <div class="postcard__preview-txt">When it comes to elliptical galaxies, we can estimate its total mass in two ways. One is by measuring the velocity dispersion of the stars and using the virial theorem. The other is by measuring the total luminosity of the galaxy, and calculating what total mass of stars is needed to produce that much light. But what about its rotation velocity, how do we calculate that? Is it different for disk galaxies? Read on more to find out.</div>

        <div class="postcard__preview-txt">Historically, the hardest problem in astronomy —is measuring the third dimension, the distance from Earth. Imagine we discover some new galaxy and measure its angular extent on the celestial sphere. But with only that information, we can’t tell if the galaxy is relatively small and nearby, or if it’s huge and billions of light years away. Thus, measuring the distance to an astronomical object, in order to make maps of the solar system, remains a crucial problem in astronomy.

But what are the telltale signs that life might be present on a planet? How can we know, from so many light years away, whether some alien form of bacteria, or shellfish, or dinosaurs, might be thriving on the surfaces of planets we can barely even spot? The answer lies in looking for biosignatures. But, what are they?
