      <p id="earthpara2">The composition and structure of Venus, our neighboring planet, offer intriguing glimpses into
        its unique characteristics. Venus is predominantly composed of rock, primarily silicate minerals like basalt and
        granite, similar to Earth. Its inner structure consists of a metallic core, possibly composed of iron and nickel,
        surrounded by a rocky mantle. However, unlike Earth, Venus lacks plate tectonics, which results in a relatively
        stagnant surface.
  
        Venus's thick atmosphere is a defining feature, comprising mainly carbon dioxide with traces of nitrogen and
        sulfur dioxide. The atmosphere creates a dense blanket that traps heat and leads to an intense greenhouse effect.
        This effect contributes to Venus's scorching surface temperatures, which soar to over 450 degrees Celsius (850
        degrees Fahrenheit), making it the hottest planet in our solar system.. </p>

      <p id="earthpara2">The exploration of Venus, our neighboring planet, has provided us with valuable insights into its
        unique characteristics and planetary processes. Beginning with flyby missions in the 1960s, followed by landers
        and orbiters, various spacecraft have ventured to Venus to study its atmosphere, surface, and geology. The Soviet
        Union's Venera missions, launched from the 1960s to the 1980s, successfully landed several probes on Venus,
        providing the first direct measurements and images of its surface. These missions revealed a harsh environment
        with high temperatures, crushing atmospheric pressures, and a corrosive atmosphere.
  
        In the 1990s, NASA's Magellan spacecraft used radar mapping techniques to map almost the entire surface of Venus,
        allowing scientists to study its topography and identify various geological features, including impact craters,
        volcanoes, and vast plains. More recently, the European Space Agency's Venus Express mission (2005-2014) explored
        Venus's atmosphere, investigating its composition, dynamics, and the enigmatic phenomenon known as
        "super-rotation," in which the atmosphere circulates much faster than the planet's rotation.</p>
